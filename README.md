## Extending telbot

You can implement two methods, `send_json` and `send_file` with your own http client to create your own API wrapper.

`send_json` should serialize `JsonMethod` into json format and send it to the API endpoint.

`send_file` should serialize `FileMethod` into `multipart/form-data` format and send it to the API endpoint.

`files(&self)` method in `FileMethod` helps getting fields of type `InputFileVariant`.

For the ease of serializing, both `JsonMethod` and `FileMethod` implements `serde::Serialize`.

`TelegramMethod`, the super trait of both `JsonMethod` and `FileMethod`, provides `name()` method,
which can be used to get the method's name in `&str` format.
